# Student-Attendance-system

The Student Management System have been developed to reduce the work of the lecturer 
and student in taking and putting class attendance. For the class attendance lecturers had to ask 
students to write down names for physical class, and if its online class they had to check the 
attendance list in the online platform and write down who have attended it and all. The major 
downfalls in this proses are lecturer might miss some student attendance, it will hard for them to 
keep record of all the attendance throughout all the semester, some students might miss to record 
their attendance even though they came to the class, and lecturer won’t know the reason for their 
absent unless they message them privately. In addition, when recording all the attendance of the 
students it will consume more time, and it will increase the workload of the lecturer, this may 
bring more stress for them. So, by implementing this Student Management System it will help 
lecturer and student to record the attendance easily, and it will be easier for them to manage the 
records of the student attendance.

This student management system will be a user-friendly system, the users don’t have to 
think so much in using the system. All the system users will have to sign in to login to the 
system, so that the student information won’t be leaked. For new users they can register to the 
system on their own and their account will be managed by the admin. The student user can 
update their detail and record their attendance. For the lecturer user they can update their details, 
check the class attendance for today, and they can also check the attendance on specific student. 
All of the details will be saved in the database system. As the result, this system will be more 
efficient and can reduce the lecturer’s work.
